# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Write bug condition exploration test
  - **Property 1: Bug Condition** - Interval Break Triggering Failure
  - **CRITICAL**: This test MUST FAIL on unfixed code - failure confirms the bug exists
  - **DO NOT attempt to fix the test or the code when it fails**
  - **NOTE**: This test encodes the expected behavior - it will validate the fix when it passes after implementation
  - **GOAL**: Surface counterexamples that demonstrate the bug exists
  - **Scoped PBT Approach**: For deterministic bugs, scope the property to the concrete failing case(s) to ensure reproducibility
  - Test implementation details from Bug Condition in design
  - The test assertions should match the Expected Behavior Properties from design
  - Run test on UNFIXED code
  - **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Test FAILS (this is correct - it proves the bug exists)
  - Document counterexamples found to understand root cause
  - Mark task complete when test is written, run, and failure is documented
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 2. Write preservation property tests (BEFORE implementing fix)
  - **Property 2: Preservation** - Normal Timer Behavior
  - **IMPORTANT**: Follow observation-first methodology
  - Observe behavior on UNFIXED code for non-buggy inputs
  - Write property-based tests capturing observed behavior patterns from Preservation Requirements
  - Property-based testing generates many test cases for stronger guarantees
  - Run tests on UNFIXED code
  - **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Tests PASS (this confirms baseline behavior to preserve)
  - Mark task complete when tests are written, run, and passing on unfixed code
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 3. Fix for interval break triggering bug

  - [ ] 3.1 Remove duplicate `last_break_time` initialization
    - Locate the duplicate initialization at line 43 in Timer.py
    - Remove lines 42-44 (including the comment and duplicate initialization)
    - Verify only one `last_break_time` initialization remains (line 35)
    - _Bug_Condition: isBugCondition(input) where input.focus_completed = true AND input.time_since_break >= input.INTERVAL AND input.break_type != "interval"_
    - _Expected_Behavior: expectedBehavior(result) from design_
    - _Preservation: Preservation Requirements from design_
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

  - [ ] 3.2 Verify `time_since_break` calculation
    - Add debug output to print `time_since_break` and `INTERVAL` values during focus completion
    - Verify calculation: `time_since_break = time.time() - st.session_state.last_break_time`
    - Ensure time values are in consistent units (seconds)
    - Test with known time differences
    - _Bug_Condition: isBugCondition(input) from design_
    - _Expected_Behavior: expectedBehavior(result) from design_
    - _Preservation: Preservation Requirements from design_
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

  - [ ] 3.3 Verify comparison logic `time_since_break >= INTERVAL`
    - Test edge cases: `time_since_break` exactly equals `INTERVAL`
    - Test with `time_since_break` slightly greater than `INTERVAL`
    - Test with `time_since_break` slightly less than `INTERVAL`
    - Ensure comparison works with floating point numbers
    - _Bug_Condition: isBugCondition(input) from design_
    - _Expected_Behavior: expectedBehavior(result) from design_
    - _Preservation: Preservation Requirements from design_
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

  - [ ] 3.4 Verify bug condition exploration test now passes
    - **Property 1: Expected Behavior** - Interval Break Triggering
    - **IMPORTANT**: Re-run the SAME test from task 1 - do NOT write a new test
    - The test from task 1 encodes the expected behavior
    - When this test passes, it confirms the expected behavior is satisfied
    - Run bug condition exploration test from step 1
    - **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Test PASSES (confirms bug is fixed)
    - _Requirements: Expected Behavior Properties from design_

  - [ ] 3.5 Verify preservation tests still pass
    - **Property 2: Preservation** - Normal Timer Behavior
    - **IMPORTANT**: Re-run the SAME tests from task 2 - do NOT write new tests
    - Run preservation property tests from step 2
    - **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Tests PASS (confirms no regressions)
    - Confirm all tests still pass after fix (no regressions)

- [ ] 4. Checkpoint - Ensure all tests pass
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise.
